File Handling
- Add a file picker form instead of just drag-and-drop.

Visualizations:
- Add a graph for unique viewers / hoverers / interactors over time, instead of the funnel chart?
- Show the percentage of the peak for each event of the funnel.
- Click on a number box to jump to a relevant visualization.
- Fix the graph when resizing back down; currently it sizes up but not down.
- Add scraping for logo and summary of extension?
- Add support for the games insights csv format.
- Review the metrics to see what else you should add, like bits or unminimizations or links. How to quantify things like churn or retention?
